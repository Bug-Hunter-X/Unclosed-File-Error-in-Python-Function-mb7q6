This repository demonstrates a common Python error: forgetting to close a file after opening it for writing. The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version using the `with` statement.  Failure to close files can lead to resource leaks and potential data loss. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed even if errors occur.
